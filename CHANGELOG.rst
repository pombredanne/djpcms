Version 0.9.0 - Development
=======================================
* This is essentially a new libary from the previous version. No more django_ dependency
  and several changes in the API.
* Working for python 2.6 up to python 3.2.
* jinja2_ shipped with the distribution and set as default template engine.
* No external dependencies for the core library.
* Object Relational mapping can be done with stdnet_, django_ or none at all.
  External ORMs can be registered to the library.    
* Introduced several new AJAX decorators.
* New AJAX decorator ``rearrange`` which adds drag & drop functionalities during page editing.
* Added abstraction for ``User``, ``Request`` and ``Response`` classes.
* Added ``save as new`` functionality to :class:`djpcms.views.appview.EditView`.
* Added ``getdata`` function to ``DjpResponse`` as the preferred way to extract data from the response object.
  In this way it is guaranteed the response object is initialised properly.
* ``forms.LazyChoiceField`` replaced by ``forms.ChoiceField``, lazy by default.
* Added :meth:`djpcms.views.appsite.Application.get_label_for_field`.
* Added a :mod:`middleware` module for logging when using ``django`` version less than ``1.3``.
* Renamed ``ApplicationBase`` as :class:`djpcms.views.appsite.Application``.
* Redesign of the test suite so that several different applications can be tested.
* Applications can be reloaded at runtime. Useful for testing, but maybe more.
* Four examples in the examples directory.
* Added more docs on views and applications.
* **72 unit tests**. Coverage **51%**.

Version 0.8.5 (2010-Nov-16)
=======================================
* Added ``object_links`` function and ``exclude_object_links``
  attribute in :class:`djpcms.views.appsite.ModelApplication`.
* Ajax delete views display a confirmation dialog box.
* Added :mod:`djpcms.contrib.flowrepo` module. Still experimental, not ready for production.
* Added django-tagging to ``libs`` module. A fall back when not available in the PYTHONPATH.
* **42 unit tests**.

=============================
* Added :mod:`djpcms.views.apps.contactus` module which implements a "Contact Us" application. Nice and simple.
* Refactoring of :func:`djpcms.views.baseview.get_page` function.
* The :attr:`djpcms.views.appview.AppViewBase.name` attribute is given by the attribute name in the application. For example::

	class MyApp(appsite.ModelApplication):
	    add = appview.AddView()
	    
  The name of the only view in ``MyApp`` is ``add``.
* Added :func:`djpcms.views.response.DjpResponse.has_own_page` function to check if a response has its own page object (rather than the ancestor one).
* Added :attr:`djpcms.models.Page.application_view` field.
* Page url calculation moved into form validation.
* Added :attr:`djpcms.views.appview.AppViewBase.plugin_form` attribute used to specify the :attr:`djpcms.plugins.DJPplugin.form` for an application view.
* Added :mod:`djpcms.core.models` module for handling models from different libraries/frameworks.
  :class:`djpcms.views.appsite.ModelApplication` can handle database models other than ``Django``.
* More documentation.
* **42 unit tests**.

Version 0.8.3 (2010-Oct-18)

  		    'djpcms.permissions.Backend',
		)
		
  in the ``settings`` file.
  
* Added :attr:`djpcms.models.BlockContent.requires_login` boolean field.
  If set to ``True`` (default is ``False``) the content block will be displayed **only**
  to authenticated users.
* Added :attr:`djpcms.models.BlockContent.for_not_authenticated` boolean field.
  If set to ``True`` (default is ``False``) the content block will be displayed **only**
  to non authenticated users.
* Added ``yui-simple3.html`` template to ``templates/djpcms/yui`` directory.
* :class:`djpcms.utils.uniforms.FormLayout` injects its ``default_style`` to
  :class:`djpcms.utils.uniforms.UniFormElement` instances without a style class defined.
* **38 unit tests**.
