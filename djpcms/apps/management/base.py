class BaseCommand(object):
    """
    The base class from which all management commands ultimately
    derive.

    Use this class if you want access to all of the mechanisms which
    parse the command-line arguments and work out what code to call in
    response; if you don't need to change any of that behavior,
    consider using one of the subclasses defined in this file.

    If you are interested in overriding/customizing various aspects of
    the command-parsing and -execution behavior, the normal flow works
    as follows:

    1. ``django-admin.py`` or ``manage.py`` loads the command class
       and calls its ``run_from_argv()`` method.

    2. The ``run_from_argv()`` method calls ``create_parser()`` to get
       an ``OptionParser`` for the arguments, parses them, performs
       any environment changes requested by options like
       ``pythonpath``, and then calls the ``execute()`` method,
       passing the parsed arguments.

    3. The ``execute()`` method attempts to carry out the command by
       calling the ``handle()`` method with the parsed arguments; any
       output produced by ``handle()`` will be printed to standard
       output and, if the command is intended to produce a block of
       SQL statements, will be wrapped in ``BEGIN`` and ``COMMIT``.

    4. If ``handle()`` raised a ``CommandError``, ``execute()`` will
       instead print an error message to ``stderr``.

    Thus, the ``handle()`` method is typically the starting point for
    subclasses; many built-in commands and command types either place
    all of their logic in ``handle()``, or perform some additional
    parsing work in ``handle()`` and then delegate from it to more
    specialized methods as needed.

    Several attributes affect behavior at various steps along the way:

    ``args``
        A string listing the arguments accepted by the command,
        suitable for use in help messages; e.g., a command which takes
        a list of application names might set this to '<appname
        appname ...>'.

    ``can_import_settings``
        A boolean indicating whether the command needs to be able to
        import Django settings; if ``True``, ``execute()`` will verify
        that this is possible before proceeding. Default value is
        ``True``.

    ``help``
        A short description of the command, which will be printed in
        help messages.

    ``option_list``
        This is the list of ``optparse`` options which will be fed
        into the command's ``OptionParser`` for parsing arguments.

    ``output_transaction``
        A boolean indicating whether the command outputs SQL
        statements; if ``True``, the output will automatically be
        wrapped with ``BEGIN;`` and ``COMMIT;``. Default value is
        ``False``.

    ``requires_model_validation``
        A boolean; if ``True``, validation of installed models will be
        performed prior to executing the command. Default value is
        ``True``. To validate an individual application's models
        rather than all applications' models, call
        ``self.validate(app)`` from ``handle()``, where ``app`` is the
        application's Python module.
