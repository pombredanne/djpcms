=====================================
Writing your first djpcms site, part 3
=====================================

Creating your first scalable dynamic application
====================================================

If there is to reed a section about this documentation, this is it.
Dynamic applications are the only reason why we build djpcms.

Dynamic applications is **the only reason** that drive us to specialise django.
dAapplications which manipulate data interact with users, collect data, give back results
can use djpcms to their advantage.


Django is deisgn to deal with dynamic applications. In Django everything is centered around models,
database pices of data. However Django provides a very general framework not designed to
provide too much magic. Djpcms, will bridge that gap at the expense of more coupling
between different technologies (sometimes coupling is good, not always).
