Sites
======================

The first concept to get familiar with is the application site.
To use ``djpcms`` to manage a web application, you need to create a 
at least one site.
A site is an instance of :class:`djpcms.apps.appsites.ApplicationSite`
and it is created simply using the high-level function
API :func:`djpcms.MakeSite`.

This is the simplest possible site you can build

.. include:: ../commons/helloworld



Djpcms has the concept of application sites where each application site contains a
set of urls which serve the applications registered with the site itself.
For example, most ``djpcms`` apps define only one site::

    from djpcms import MakeSite
    
    def get_urls():
        ...
    
    site = MakeSite(__file__, APPLICATION_URLS = get_urls)

where ``sites`` is an instance of :class:`ApplicationSites`.
