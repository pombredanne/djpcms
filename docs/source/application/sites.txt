Sites
======================

The first concept to get familiar when using djpcms is the application site.

.. note::

    When using ``djpcms`` to manage a web application, you need to create a 
    at least one application site. This is easy to do using the
    :func:`djpcms.MakeSite` high level function.

This is the simplest possible site you can build

.. include:: ../commons/helloworld
