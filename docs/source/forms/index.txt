Forms and Layouts
=====================

Forms are crucial not only for browser driven application, but also for
rpc, command line, driven applications.
This is way djpcms has its own from library::

    from djpcms import forms
    
    class IssueForm(forms.Form):
        name = forms.CharField()
        description = forms.CharField(widget = forms.TextArea(),
                                      required= False)
        labels = forms.CharField(required=False)
