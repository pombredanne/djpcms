Djp Response
================

Throughout the library there is constant reference to the :class:`djpcms.views.DjpResponse`
class as first arguments of several functions.
Indeed instances of this class carry around information about views, request and responses.

Navigation Utilities
============================

There are two lazy generators useful for creating internal links, menus and breadcrumb elements.

.. _topics-included-navigator:

Navigator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Navigator can be used to generate navigation menus.

.. autoclass:: djpcms.utils.navigation.Navigator
   :members:
   :member-order: bysource


.. _topics-included-breadcrumbs:

Breadcrumbs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is my favorite navigation utility. Given a url it build a list of previous url elements.
Each element is a dictionary contaning ``name`` and ``url``. The last element in the list, the
the current url, won't contain the ``url`` value in the dictionary so that an internal link to
the same page is not created in the HTML document.

The ``name`` value is calculated in the view method :ref:`topics-views-title`.

Breadcrumbs are available in the context dictionary with key ``breadcrumbs``.

See :ref:`topics-views-context-dictionary`
