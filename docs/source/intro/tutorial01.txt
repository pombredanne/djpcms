What is Djpcms?
=====================

It's a content management system for *dynamic* 
web applications which uses python_
on the server side and javascript on browser-side.
The Javascript is largely built on top of jQuery_ and
several open-source jQuery plugins.


What Djpcms is NOT?
=====================
It is not a web-framework in the sense that it does not provide all the
nuts and bolts required by a web-application.
You can use it as a python library if you like,
but it is not designed to be flexible enough to accomodate for a large
variety of usages.
It does what it is supposed to do, providing support
for managing contents on the web.


Using Djpcms
============================== 
With djpcms you can build web-sites with ease and add *dynamic*
contents if you can write python code.
It can be customized using settings files and it can use
several open-source python libraries to expand its capabilities:
django_, jinja2_, stdnet_, etc...
