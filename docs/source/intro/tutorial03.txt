Writing your first site, part 3

Creating your first scalable dynamic application
====================================================

If there is to reed a section about this documentation, this is it.

Dynamic applications is **the only reason** that drive us to specialise django.
Applications which manipulate data interact with users, collect data, give back results
can use djpcms to their advantage.


Django is designed to deal with dynamic applications.
In Django everything is centered around models, database pieces of data and
it provides a general framework without too much magic.
Djpcms, will bridge that gap at the expense of more coupling
between different technologies (sometimes coupling is good).
