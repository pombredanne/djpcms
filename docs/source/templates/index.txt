Templates
============================
   
Djpcms does not includes a template library.
However, a template library is an important tool when developing
web applications and that is why djpcms comes with battery
included binding for django_ and jinja2_ templating.

To use the template::

    from djpcms.template import handle
    
    loader = handle('django')
    loader.render("mytemplatefile.html",ContexDict)
    
or simply::
    
    from djpcms.template import loader
    
    loader.render("mytemplatefile.html",ContexDict)
    
In this last case, the template library chosen is pecified in the
application settings. In both cases, ``loader`` is an instance of
:class:`djpcms.template.BaseTemplateHandler`, a class which defines
the high-level interface with the template libraries.
    
API
=============
The api is minimalist, because djpcms believe the havy-lifting should be done
by the python code with the template library providing support for
layout.
