Model Application
======================

The Basics
=========================

Lets assume we have a model called `Project`, the basics step sto setup an application are the following:
    
    * A dynamic application is created by subclassing `ModelApplication` defined in djpcms.views.appsite.options::
        
        from djpcms.views.appsite import ModelApplication
        
        class ProjectApplication(ModelApplication):
            baseurl = '/project/'
    
    * The dynamic application class must specify the baseurl of the application (including trailing slashes).
    * A dynamic application is registered to the site by invoking::
        
        appsite.site.register(Project,ProjectApplication)
        

ModelApplication Class

.. autoclass:: djpcms.views.appsite.ModelApplication
