Model Application
======================

The Basics
=========================

Lets assume we have a model called `Project`, to setup an ``djpcms`` application we create a class derived from
:ref:`modelapplication-class` ::

	from djpcms.views import appsite
	
	class ProjectApplication(appsite.ModelApplication):
	    pass
    
A dynamic application is registered to the site by invoking::
	
	appsite.site.register('/project/', Project, ProjectApplication)
        

.. _modelapplication-class:

ModelApplication Class
=========================

.. autoclass:: djpcms.views.appsite.ModelApplication
   :members:
   :inherited-members:
   :member-order: bysource
