======================
Model Application
======================

The Basics
=========================

Lets assume we have a model called `Project`, to setup an ``djpcms`` application we create a class derived from
:ref:`modelapplication-class` ::

	from djpcms.views import appsite
	
	class ProjectApplication(appsite.ModelApplication):
	    pass
    
A dynamic application is registered to the site by invoking::
	
	appsite.site.register('/project/', Project, ProjectApplication)
        

This application is pretty useles since it has no ``views``. To add views we need to go to the
``djpcms.views.appview`` module where we find the :class:`djpcms.views.appview.AppView` which is the
base class of all model applications.
