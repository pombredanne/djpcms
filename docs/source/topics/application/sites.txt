Application Sites
======================

Djpcms has the concept of application sites where each application site contains a
set of urls which serve the applications registered with the site itself.
For example, most ``djpcms`` apps define only one site::

    from djpcms import MakeSite
    
    def get_urls():
        ...
    
    site = MakeSite(__file__, APPLICATION_URLS = get_urls)
