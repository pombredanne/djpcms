Autocomplete
============================

Djpcms comes with autocomplete__ functionalities out of the box. The autocomplete is associated with a
database model and its registered :class:`djpcms.views.appsite.ModelApplication`.

Lets say we have the following model (from vinoweb example)::

	class Grape(models.Model):
	    name = models.CharField(unique = True, max_length = 200)
	    extended = models.CharField(blank = True, max_length = 500)
    	
    	 
There are four points to have autocomplete working for a model:

* Your model application must have a ``search_fields`` list.
* Your model application must have the :class:`djpcms.views.appview.AutocompleteView`::

	from djpcms.views import appsite,appview
	
	class GrapeApp(appsite.ModelApplication):
	    search_fields = ['name','extended']
	    autocomplete = appview.AutocompleteView(display = 'name')
		
* Register your application as usual::

	appsite.site.register('/grape/', GrapeApp, model = Grape)
	
* When using the model in Forms, import from ``djpcms.forms`` and not ``django.forms``::

	from djpcms import forms
	
	class WineForm(forms.Form):
	    grape = forms.ModelChoiceField(queryset = Grape.objects.all())
	    name  = forms.CharField()
		

There is also a :ref:`tagging autocomplete <tag-autocomplete>` functionality.
