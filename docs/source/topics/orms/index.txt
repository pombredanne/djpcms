Object Relational Mapping
==================================

`Object Relational Mapping <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping>`_ (ORM) in
computer software is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible
type systems in databases and object-oriented programming languages.

There are two famous ORM for Python: SQLAlchemy_ and django_ models.
Both of them are fully feature open-source libraries with an incredible community
of users and developers.
