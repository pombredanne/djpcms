Add Related Object View
===========================

This is a very very useful view for adding related objects to an existing 
model instance. The view is derived from :class:`djpcms.views.appview.EditView`
and therefore it is an object view.

Let's say we have these the following two models::

	class Author(models.Model):
	    name = models.CharField(max_length = 60)
	
	
	class Book(models.Model):
	    title = models.CharField(max_length = 200)
	    author = models.ForeignKey(Author)
	
	
The view would become::

	class BookForm(forms.ModelForm):
	    author = forms.CharField()
	    
	    
	class AddBookView(appview.EditView):
	    _form = BookForm
	    
	    def get_form(self, djp, initial = None,
	                 instance = False, **kwargs):
	        initial = initial or {}
	        initial['author'] = djp.instance.id
	        return super(AddBookView,self).get_form(djp,instance=False,
	                                                initial=initial,**kwargs)
