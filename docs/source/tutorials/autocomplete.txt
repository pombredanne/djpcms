=========================

To activate autocomplete for a :class:`djpcms.views.Application` there
are few steps to follow:

* Setup a serch engine for your application.
* Set :attr:`djpcms.views.Application.autocomplete_fields` list for limiting the number of
  fields to retrieve from the database (speed up).
  
  
Choice Field in a form
==========================

A typical example::

    from djpcms import forms
    from djpcms.apps import search
    
    class StrategyForm(forms.Form):
        '''Form for adding a new strategy to a portfolio'''
        portfolio = forms.ChoiceField(choices = get_portfolios)
        strategy = forms.ChoiceField(choices = search.Search(model = Strategy),
                                     autocomplete = True)
