Plugins
============================

Plugins are the design principle of ``djpcms``. Plugins are components
that add capabilities to ``djpcms`` which, in turns, acts as a manager
and placeholder for them.
Adding your own is extremely simple as well as moving them around
in a page.

Plugins are classes which derive from :class:`DJPplugin`,
a straightforward python class. Plugins are not
database models, they simply describe how content is displayed
in a page and how users can interact with them. Thats it!

.. admonition:: Plugins from application views

    Most plugins are strictly connected with :class:`djpcms.views.View`
    as we will see shortly.

.. admonition:: How do we tell djpcms to include our plugins?

    Including plugins in your application is easy, simply add their dotted
    path to the :setting:`DJPCMS_PLUGINS` setting.
