What is Djpcms?
=====================

It's a content management system for *dynamic* 
web applications which uses python_
on the server side and javascript on browser-side.
The Javascript is largely built on top of jQuery_ and
several open-source jQuery plugins (:ref:`check the list here <jquery-plugins>`).
On the Python side no dependency are strictly required. 


What Djpcms is NOT?
=====================
It is not a web-framework in the sense that it does not provide all the
nuts and bolts required by a web-application.
It does what it is supposed to do, providing support
for managing contents and interaction on the web in a fast and efficient manner.
You can also use it as a python library.


Using Djpcms
============================== 
With djpcms you can build web-sites with ease and add *dynamic*
contents if you can write python code.
It can be customized using :ref:`settings files <topics-settings>`
and it can use several open-source python libraries to expand its capabilities:
django_, stdnet_, etc...
