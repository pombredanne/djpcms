Introduction

What is Djpcms?
=====================

It's a content management system for *dynamic*
web applications which uses python_
on the server side and javascript on browser-side.
The Javascript is largely built on top of jQuery_ and
several open-source jQuery plugins (:ref:`check the list here <jquery-plugins>`).
On the Python side the only strict dependency is pulsar_.


What Djpcms is NOT?
=====================
It is not a web-framework in the sense that it does not try to be
as general as possible. It helps manage and display content on the web in
a fast and efficient manner.
You can also use it as a python library.


Using Djpcms
==============================
With djpcms you can build web-sites with ease and add *dynamic*
contents if you can write python code.
It can be customized using :ref:`settings files <topics-settings>`
and it can use several open-source python libraries to expand its capabilities.
