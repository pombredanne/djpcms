How to install Djpcms
=====================

This document will get you up and running with Django.

Install Python
==============

Being a Python Web framework, Django requires Python.

It works with any Python version from 2.5 to 2.6 (due to backwards
incompatibilities in Python 3.0, Django does not currently work with
Python 3.0; see :ref:`the Django FAQ <faq-install>` for more
information on supported Python versions and the 3.0 transition).

Get Python at http://www.python.org. If you're running Linux or Mac OS X, you
probably already have it installed.
