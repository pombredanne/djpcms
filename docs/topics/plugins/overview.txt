Plugin Overview
============================

Plugin are the natural way to extend djpcms capabilities.

The basics:

    * Each plugin is a Python class that subclasses djpcms.plugins.DJPplugin.
    * Each plugin must implement the render method.
    * Each Plugin can specify a Form for entering user options.



The render method

The plugin url
======================

Some Plugins are simple and do not have any interaction with the user. Other plugins are far
more dynamic, requiring a back end url for user interaction.
If the plugin URL property is not set, the plugin url is constructed using the :setting:`DJPCMS_PLUGIN_BASE_URL`
and the plugin name.
